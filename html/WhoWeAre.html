<h2>Annamareeâ€™s first batch of essential donations</h2>
<img src="" alt="">
<p>
This organisation was founded on pivotal moments, growing roots of empathy for others. Whilst searching for a sense of purpose, Annamaree Le Brun, the founder and Chairperson of education, education, education discovered that we all need to do more without expecting anything in return. We all have a responsibility to become better citizens. We all need to be mindful of mother earth. 

Annamaree was moved by the different sectors of the community who immediately came to unite as key contributors to a common cause; supporting the people in our community who are subsisting to survive on a daily basis.
